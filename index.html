   'Walking Dead': 5 Things Negan's Kills Mean for the Show</h1>

        <p>Two major characters meet their maker in the season-premiere cliffhanger-what does this mean for the series?</p>
    
        <p>Should The Walking Dead fans really have been shocked by who died in the Season Seven premiere? Looking back, the outcome was obvious. Jeffrey Dean Morgan – who plays Negan, the murderous leader of post-apocalyptic ravagers known as "the Saviors" – hinted in interviews over the summer that he might be killing more than one character when the show came back from its Season Six cliffhanger. And as readers of the comics know, at this point in the story, both Abraham and Glenn are gone. Abraham catches an arrow through the head in The Walking Dead #98; and Glenn gets bludgeoned by Negan's spiked baseball bat in the infamous issue #100.
